	<h1 class="welcome-text animated slideInLeft">WHAT IS OTOLOGY?</h1>
	<br/><br/>
	<p>
		Otology is the branch of medicine concerned with the study of the ear and its diseases. This discipline is part of otorhinolaryngology, the speciality concerned with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ear, nose and throat. Unlike otorhinolaryngologists (also known as Ear, Nose and Throat [ENT] specialists), otologists do not treat diseases of the nose and neck. Otologists are specialised in the physiology, function and diseases of the ear. Otology is a branch of medicine and surgery; as such otologists are also qualified to perform surgical interventions.
<br>
		<br>
        Neurotology, a related field of medicine and subspecialty of otolaryngology, is the study of diseases of the inner ear, which can lead to hearing and balance disorders. Neurotologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the inner ear or surgery that involves entering the inner ear with risk to the hearing and balance organs, including labyrinthectomy, cochlear implant surgery, and surgery for tumors of the temporal bone, such as intracanalicular acoustic neuromas. Neurotology is expanded to include surgery of the lateral skull base to treat intracranial tumors related to the ear and surrounding nerve and vascular structures, such as large cerebellar pontine angle acoustic neuromas, glomus jugulare tumors and facial nerve tumors.

<h1 class="welcome-text animated slideInLeft">WHICH DISEASE DOES OTOLOGY CURE?</h1>
		<br>
        <p> Otology is dedicated to treating ear problems, so not only hearing problems but also balance problems. The ear plays a fundamental role in balance and the sensation of vertigo and dizziness. Some of the most common pathologies in the otology clinic are the following:
        <br>
            <br>
            Otitis or ear infection: very frequent, especially in babies and children.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tinnitus: annoying perception of continuous sound or ringing, which sometimes prevents the patient from hearing clearly.
            <br>
            <br>
            Barotrauma: a lesion caused by changes in barometric (air) or water pressure.
            <br>
            <br>
            Menière’s disease: a common cause of vertigo and dizziness, due to liquid problems in the middle ear. It also usually causes tinnitus.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h1 class="welcome-text animated slideInLeft">What are the subspecialties within otology?</h1>
    <p>Otology is focused on the study of the ear and is a subspecialty of otorhinolaryngology. Professionals may further specialise in a specific disease or a specific part of the ear (external, middle or internal ear), for example, damage to the eardrum or middle ear surgery.</p>
	<h1 class="welcome-text animated slideInLeft">When would I have to visit the otologist?</h1>
    <p>You may need to visit the otologist if you experience changes in hearing, or pain or discomfort in your ears, or dizziness or vertigo.</p>
