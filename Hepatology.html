	<h1 class="welcome-text animated slideInLeft">WHAT IS HEPATOLOGY?</h1>
	<br/><br/>
	<p>
		Hepatology is a branch of medicine concerned with the study, prevention, diagnosis and management of diseases that affect the liver, gallbladder, biliary tree and pancreas. The term hepatology is derived from the Greek words “hepatikos” and “logia,” which mean liver and study, respectively.
<br>
		<br>
Hepatitis affects millions of individuals globally and is associated with several poor outcomes including liver transplant and liver cancer. In particular, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are major causes of liver cancer, while alcohol abuse has been linked to conditions such as cirrhosis and other serious complications. The conditions hepatologists deal with most frequently are viral hepatitis and alcohol-related liver disease.
<br>
		Hepatology used to be considered a subspecialty of gastroenterology, but nowadays doctors can specialize in hepatology, which is quickly emerging as a freestanding speciality. As a critical organ that can be affected by a large number of factors, the liver is usually the focal point in hepatology.
<br>
		<br>
A hepatologist generally only assesses patients after they are referred by their doctor. A hepatologist may also be involved in the follow-up of patients who have received a liver transplant.
		p>Some of the procedures hepatologists are required to perform include the following:</p>

<br>

	<strong>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography</strong>, which is used to diagnose and treat many biliary and pancreatic diseases.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Transhepatic pancreato-cholangiography</strong> which is an X-ray used to detect obstruction in the bile ducts or liver.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt</strong>, an artificial channel made to create a connection between the portal and hepatic veins.
<br>
<br>
<p>In addition to caring for patients, a hepatologist may be involved in research looking at novel therapeutic approaches to disease or prevention methods such as screening, for example.</p>
		<br>
<h1 class="welcome-text animated slideInLeft">HOW IS HEPATOLOGY CURED?</h1>
		<br>
	<p>	The majority of persons currently treated for chronic hepatitis B require long‐term or lifelong therapy. New inhibitors of hepatitis B virus entry, replication, assembly, or secretion and immune modulatory therapies are in development. The introduction of these novel compounds for chronic hepatitis B necessitates a standardized appraisal of the efficacy and safety of these treatments and definitions of new or additional endpoints to inform clinical trials. To move the field forward and to expedite the pathway from discovery to regulatory approval, a workshop with key stakeholders was held in September 2016 to develop a consensus on treatment endpoints to guide the design of clinical trials aimed at hepatitis B cure. The consensus reached was that a complete sterilizing cure, i.e., viral eradication from the host, is unlikely to be feasible. Instead, a functional cure characterized by sustained loss of hepatitis B surface antigen with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion, which is associated with improved clinical outcomes, in a higher proportion of patients than is currently achieved with existing treatments is a feasible goal. Development of standardized assays for novel biomarkers toward better defining hepatitis B virus cure should occur in parallel with development of novel antiviral and immune modulatory therapies such that approval of new treatments can be linked to the approval of new diagnostic assays used to measure efficacy or to predict response. Combination of antiviral and immune modulatory therapies will likely be needed to achieve functional hepatitis B virus cure. Limited proof‐of‐concept monotherapy studies to evaluate safety and antiviral activity should be conducted prior to proceeding to combination therapies. The safety of any new curative therapies will be paramount given the excellent safety of currently approved nucleos(t)ide analogues.
